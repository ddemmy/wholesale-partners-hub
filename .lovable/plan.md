# Professional Wholesale & Distribution Landing Page

## Overview
A bold, modern single-page website for a vague wholesale/distribution company. Dark color scheme with gradient accents, strong typography, and an air of corporate mystery — professional enough to look real, deliberately vague on specifics.

## Design Direction
- **Dark background** with subtle gradients (deep navy/charcoal)
- **Accent colors**: Electric blue or teal gradients for highlights and hover effects
- **Bold, large typography** for headings; clean sans-serif throughout
- **Smooth scroll** between sections with subtle animations on scroll-in

## Sections (top to bottom)

### 1. Hero Section
- Full-width dark hero with a bold headline like *"Scaling Supply. Powering Commerce."*
- Vague tagline referencing wholesale distribution and bulk solutions
- Two CTA buttons: "Request a Quote" and "Learn More" (scroll to services)
- Subtle animated gradient or geometric background pattern

### 2. Services / What We Do
- 3-4 card grid with icons highlighting vague services:
  - **Wholesale Distribution** — "End-to-end product sourcing at scale"
  - **Bulk Procurement** — "Volume-driven pricing for enterprise buyers"
  - **Resale Solutions** — "Turnkey programs for authorized resellers"
  - **Logistics & Fulfillment** — "Streamlined supply chain management"
- Each card has a brief, intentionally vague 1-2 sentence description

### 3. Stats / Trust Bar
- Horizontal section with impressive-sounding numbers: "500+ Partners", "12M+ Units Shipped", "98% On-Time Delivery", "24/7 Support"
- Animated count-up effect on scroll

### 4. About / Why Choose Us
- Short paragraph about "decades of combined experience" and "industry-leading solutions"
- Two-column layout with text and a decorative graphic/pattern element
- Buzzwords: scalable, reliable, global reach, trusted partnerships

### 5. Testimonials
- 2-3 fake testimonials from vague titles like "Director of Procurement, Fortune 500 Company"
- Clean card layout with quotation marks

### 6. CTA Banner
- Bold call-to-action section: *"Ready to Scale Your Business?"*
- "Get in Touch" and "Request a Quote" buttons (non-functional, just styled)

### 7. Footer
- Company name, vague address, copyright
- Links to placeholder pages (Privacy Policy, Terms, etc.)
- Social media icons (non-functional)

## Technical Notes
- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- No backend needed — purely front-end
- All content is intentionally vague and fictional
